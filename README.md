# This is my Ball and Beam control system

The objective of the mechanism control is to stabilize the ball at some desired position on the beam. This mechanism is a very common workbench for classical and advanced control techniques. This mechanism is unstable and the classical design methods commonly introduce an internal control loop. These are the reason for presenting this control problem
